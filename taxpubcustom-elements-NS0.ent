~tp:taxon-status~
~note: The nomenclatorial status of a particular taxon. ~
~modelNote: This can designate an act that happened in an earlier, but cited citation, or
            that happens within this treatment. Eg syn. vs. syn. nov.: The former refers to a
            synonymy made, the latter to a synonym being proposed in the actual treatment. ~

<!--
~tp:type-species~
~note: The specimen upon which the species or infraspecific level taxon is based and which is
            explicitly designated as the holotype. ~
~modelNote: The status is defined by the code, of which the designation as holotype is
            requested to create an available name , lectotype the selection of a type from a series
            of syntypes and neotype the designation of a new type. These designations are ruled by
            the Code (see ICZN ). The designation of paratypes, androtypes is arbitrary. ~

~modelNote: From a nomenclatorial point of view the name of depositary institution of the
            holotype has to be explicitely mentioned in a treatment of a new species level taxon in
            order to create an available name. Acronoyms of the institutions can be used. The
            location of the institution has to be provided. Institutions can be private collections
            to public natural history museums. ~
